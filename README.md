# Monopoly-Dice-Simulator
Building a Dice Simulator for Monopoly with Python (Python Practice Project)

This is a Python practice project for participants in the Chaptr Data Science Cohort. Below are the project details:

# Project Description
Monopoly is one of the most interesting board games to unleash your inner capitalist! If you would like to learn how to play Monopoly, visit this Wiki How Page. However, in this project all you have to understand the rules of rolling dice in monopoly:

In Monopoly, players roll two dice in when it is their time to play, they then move the number of steps equal to the sum of the result of Dice 1 and Dice 2. If the results on both dice are the same, the player gets to roll the dice again. However, if the results of both dice are the same for three consecutive times (during a playerâ€™s turn), they are sent to Jail!

## Overall Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Dice Rolling Simulator that adheres to the Monopoly Dice Rules. Since you have not done GUI (Graphical User Interface), this program should not really be graphical, all you need is dice result and the total number of steps a user should move whenever the program is run.

This project requires you to use Random Module tor randomize the dice results. This is an easy Python module that you can learn by visiting the Randon Documentation. Here is what the program should entail:

- Two dice should be rolled at any given time (This is the standard for the Monopoly Board Game)
- The program should output the results for both dice when it is run (a random number from 1 to 6 for either) as well as the total steps a user should move (sum of the dice results)
- If the results of both dice are similar, the dice should be rolled again automatically and the total steps to be moved will now be the sum of all dice results on each of the rounds.
- However, if the dice results are similar for a third consecutive time, the user should be prompted to GO TO JAIL!
- Remember to break down your approach to this challenge by introducing comments to make your code more readable/understandable. Also, adhere to the naming conventions and make your variable name descriptive.
